Scope
------

$watch: (watchFn, listenerFn, valueEq)
whenever watchFn(scope) return a new value, listenFn((newValue, newValue, scope)) is called. valueEq decides whether _.isEqual or === is used to compare.
returns a function that can be called to destroy the watch.

$eval(expr, locals)
evaluates expr with parameter locals

$apply(expr)
evaluates exp and calls $digest

$digest
checks the watchers until no one changed

$evalAsync
evaluates an expression in the next digest loop. Advantage over timeout is that it does it before it can render stuff or do anything else.

$applyAsync
evaluates in the next digest loop. In contrast to to $evalAsync it does not evaluate in the current digest cycle.
